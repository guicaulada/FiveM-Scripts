The vrp_basic_menu is an interface for you to create menus and buttons with some example features included, and I'm always adding more, but the main purpose of it is for you to have a tool to create your own static menus and buttons without changing the source code of vRP.

If you want to use one of the examples they are based on permissions. You can find those on the server.lua file like so: 

```
-- ADD STATIC MENU CHOICES // STATIC MENUS NEED TO BE ADDED AT vRP/cfg/gui.lua
vRP.addStaticMenuChoices({"police_weapons", police_weapons}) -- police gear
vRP.addStaticMenuChoices({"emergency_medkit", emergency_medkit}) -- pills and medkits
vRP.addStaticMenuChoices({"emergency_heal", emergency_heal}) -- heal button
-- REMEMBER TO ADD THE PERMISSIONS FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO USE
-- CREATES PLAYER SUBMENU AND ADD CHOICES
local ch_player_menu = {function(player,choice)
	local user_id = vRP.getUserId({player})
	local menu = {}
	menu.name = "Player"
	menu.css = {top = "75px", header_color = "rgba(0,0,255,0.75)"}
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"player.store_money"}) then
      menu["Store money"] = choice_store_money -- transforms money in wallet to money in inventory to be stored in houses and cars
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"player.store_weapons"}) then
      menu["Store weapons"] = choice_store_weapons -- store player weapons, like police store weapons from vrp
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"player.check"}) then
      menu["Inspect"] = choice_player_check -- checks nearest player inventory, like police check from vrp
    end
	
	vRP.openMenu({player, menu})
end}
-- REGISTER MAIN MENU CHOICES
vRP.registerMenuBuilder({"main", function(add, data)
  local user_id = vRP.getUserId({data.player})
  if user_id ~= nil then
    local choices = {}
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"player.player_menu"}) then
      choices["Player"] = ch_player_menu -- opens player submenu
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"toggle.service"}) then
      choices["Service"] = choice_service -- toggle the receiving of missions
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"player.loot"}) then
      choices["Loot"] = choice_loot -- take the items of nearest player in coma
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"mugger.mug"}) then
      choices["Mug"] = ch_mug -- steal nearest player wallet
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"hacker.hack"}) then
      choices["Hack"] = ch_hack --  1 in 100 chance of stealing 1% of nearest player bank
    end
	
    add(choices)
  end
end})
-- RESGISTER ADMIN MENU CHOICES
vRP.registerMenuBuilder({"admin", function(add, data)
  local user_id = vRP.getUserId({data.player})
  if user_id ~= nil then
    local choices = {}
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"player.blips"}) then
      choices["@Blips"] = ch_blips -- turn on map blips and sprites
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"player.sprites"}) then
      choices["@Sprites"] = ch_sprites -- turn on only name sprites
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"admin.crun"}) then
      choices["@Crun"] = ch_crun -- run any client command, any GTA V client native http://www.dev-c.com/nativedb/
    end
	
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"admin.srun"}) then
      choices["@Srun"] = ch_srun -- run any server command, any GTA V server native http://www.dev-c.com/nativedb/
    end
	
    add(choices)
  end
end})
-- REGISTER POLICE MENU CHOICES
vRP.registerMenuBuilder({"police", function(add, data)
  local user_id = vRP.getUserId({data.player})
  if user_id ~= nil then
    local choices = {}
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"police.store_money"}) then
      choices["Store money"] = choice_store_money -- transforms money in wallet to money in inventory to be stored in houses and cars
    end
    if vRP.hasPermission({user_id,"police.drag"}) then
      choices["Drag"] = ch_drag -- [TESTING] Should toggle drag of closest player (DO NOT USE)
    end
    add(choices)
  end
end})
```

The permission displayed on the hasPermission function for example "player.store_money" is necessary for a group from vrp/cfg/groups.lua to have access to certain feature, and the same for other features.

Good luck.
