# FiveM Scripts

Any improvements you make on this scripts **must** be published on GitHub. 

 
Make a Fork and then make your changes as a new Branch, make the Pull Request, every new change sould be in a new Branch based on Master.  
Master should always be equal to the one in the project, so keep it updated.  
You can see an example of that on my TinyChatBot Fork.  


This way we can all share our improvements, like the community was supposed to be.
